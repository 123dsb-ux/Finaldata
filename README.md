Finaldata is a comprehensive dataset containing 16,885 smoke fire images captured in an uncontrolled environment. The images are taken from the DFire dataset and 6 datasets obtained by web crawlers. In order to ensure the high quality and diversity of the dataset, we performed rigorous data cleaning to remove a large number of duplicate and invalid samples. The dataset contains two scenarios, urban fire and forest fire, and is labeled with two categories: fire and smoke, including 5867 images containing only flames, 3164 images containing smoke only, 4754 images containing fire and smoke, 9347 images of cities, and 7538 images of forests. The cleaned images were integrated with the independently collected images, and randomly divided into the training set and the test set at a 5:1 ratio. The cleaned images were integrated with the independently collected images, and randomly divided into the training set and the test set at a 5:1 ratio. This approach not only ensures the richness of the training set, but also provides reliable test data for model evaluation.
